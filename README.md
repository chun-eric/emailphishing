### Step 1: Identifying the Specific Risk 💥 
The primary objective of this step is to educate end-users about the risks associated with clicking on compromised email. 
To enhance the relevance and urgency of this message, we provide a real-life example demonstrating the potential negative impacts of being email phished, 
emphasizing the importance of always handling email links and susupicious email with extreme care.

### Step 2: Providing Remediation and Solutions 👍
Once the risk has been clearly articulated, the next step involves offering practical remediation strategies. 

This includes noticing the clear signs of an email phishing attack and clear steps end users can take to mitigate and counter these attacks.

### Step 3: Effective Communication Strategies 📑 
Determining the target audience is crucial for effective communication. 
This training is designed specifically for all personnel within the organization. 

The training content, which is a Just-In-Time video, is distributed directly via embedded email, to avoid external links and ensure ease of access.

<br/>

### Step 4: Monitoring Engagement and Effectiveness 👋 
Following the distribution of the training material, it is vital to monitor engagement and gather metrics 
to assess the training's impact. 

This includes tracking who has watched the video, engagement levels, and viewing duration. 

Such metrics are instrumental in evaluating the training's effectiveness. 
Additionally, for those who have not engaged with the material, 
a follow-up reminder will be sent to encourage their participation.
